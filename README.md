## **🛠️ Your First Task: Personalizing the Profile Page**  
Your first **development task** is to update the **Profile Page** by modifying user details.

```  

---

### **Step 2: Create a Feature Branch**
To follow best practices, always **create a new feature branch** before making changes.

1️⃣ Create a branch named after yourself (e.g., `feature-john-doe`):  

```sh
git checkout -b feature-your-name
```
Example:  

```sh
git checkout -b feature-alex-smith
```

2️⃣ Verify that you are on the new branch:  

```sh
git branch
```

✅ **Expected Output:** You should see `feature-your-name` highlighted.

---

### **Step 3: Modify the Profile Page**
1️⃣ Open the project folder in **VS Code (or any editor)**.  
2️⃣ Locate the **Profile Page file** (`profile.html`).  
3️⃣ Update the **Name, Email, and Contact Details** with your own **(avoid confidential data)**.  
4️⃣ Keep the **format and styling** intact.  
5️⃣ (Bonus) **Add an extra field** like **"Hobbies" or "LinkedIn Profile"** for personalization.

```sh
git status
```

2️⃣ Stage the changes:  

```sh
git add profile.html

```sh
git commit -m "Updated profile page with my details"
```

---

### **Step 5: Push Changes to GitHub**
1️⃣ Push your changes to your feature branch:  

```sh
git push origin feature-your-name
```
Example:  

```sh
git push origin feature-alex-smith
```

---

### **Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR)**
1️⃣ Go to the **GitHub repository**:  
👉 [Mini Finance GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pravinmishraaws/mini_finance)

## Assignment: Run a 5-Day Mini-Sprint in Jira and Ship an Increment

### ✅ Jira Setup
- **Create new project in Jira:** `Mini Finance`
- **Create new epic:** Created

### 🧾 Story Details

**Summary:** Add footer with version and deploy date  
**Description:**  
Show `Mini Finance v1.0 — Deployed on <DD Mon YYYY> — By <Student Name>` in the footer of all pages.

**Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin):**
```gherkin
Scenario: Footer shows version and deploy date
  Given I open the homepage
  When the page loads
  Then I see the exact text "Mini Finance v1.0 — Deployed on <DD Mon YYYY> — By <Student Name>"
  And this is visible on the public EC2 URL

Story point estimate: 1 
Labels: frontend

**Create sub tasks under the story and add below descriptions:**

Day 1 – Implement & Deploy
Implement footer (HTML/CSS)
Commit & push
Deploy to EC2
Verify on EC2 & screenshot

Day 2 – Make date dynamic
Update with the today’s date (e.g., 26 Aug 2025)
Commit & push
Deploy & screenshot footer + code snippet in README

Day 3 – Polish & Accessibility
Tweak footer font size/spacing; ensure contrast ≥ AA
Test mobile (narrow viewport) & desktop (Use Chatgpt)
Deploy & screenshot on both sizes

Day 4 – Provenance / Health (Use ChatGPT)
Add short commit hash or env tag (e.g., rev: abc123)
(If not comfortable, add simple /healthz page returning “OK” instead)
Verify with browser and curl
Deploy & screenshot (footer and/or health check)

Day 5 – Review & Retro
Record 2–3 min demo of EC2 URL
Write Retro comment (What went well / Improve / Pillar & Value seen)
Capture end-of-sprint Burndown screenshot

Move the story from Backlog to Sprint 1
